## _seroepirecipes_: implementations and tutorials of common models in seroepidemiology <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="130"/>
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

***seroepirecipes***  implements and links to R packages implementing commonly used mathematical and statistical models for analyzing serological data. The package implements a range of methods in R vignettes, from fitting antibody kinetics models to longitudinal antibody titer data, estimating the force of infection using serocatalytic models, and inferring infection histories using time-since-infection methods. This codebase accompanies a [literature review](https://osf.io/kqdsn) of analytical methods for seroepidemiology. 

All of the tutorials use either simulated datasets from the [serosim](https://seroanalytics.github.io/serosim/) R-package or publicly available datasets.

## DEVELOPER TO DO
* Include Stan models within source code rather than vignette-specific scripts.
* Attach example datasets
* Move the jahR antibody kinetics functions here

## _seroepirecipes_: implementations and tutorials of common models in seroepidemiology <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="130"/>
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

***seroepirecipes***  implements and links to R packages implementing commonly used mathematical and statistical models for analyzing serological data. We implement a range of methods in R vignettes, from fitting antibody kinetics models to longitudinal antibody titer data, estimating the force of infection using serocatalytic models, and inferring infection histories using time-since-infection methods.

## Contents
* Description of datasets included in ***seroepirecipes***
* Fitting a hierarchical antibody kinetics model to longitudinal antibody measurements
* Using mixture models to classify serostatus
* Estimating the force of infection using serocatalytic models
* Infection times using reversible jump MCMC
* Inferring infection histories using _serosolver_

## Installation

``` r
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("seroanalytics/seroepirecipes")
```

## _seroepirecipes_: implementations and tutorials of common models in seroepidemiology <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="130"/>
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

***seroepirecipes***  implements and links to R packages implementing commonly used mathematical and statistical models for analyzing serological data. We implement a range of methods in R vignettes, from fitting antibody kinetics models to longitudinal antibody titer data, estimating the force of infection using serocatalytic models, and inferring infection histories using time-since-infection methods.

## Contents
* (WIP) Description of datasets included in ***seroepirecipes***
* (WIP) Fitting a hierarchical antibody kinetics model to longitudinal antibody measurements
* (WIP) Using mixture models to classify serostatus
* [Estimating the force of infection using serocatalytic models](https://seroanalytics.github.io/seroepirecipes/articles/serocatalytic_model.html)
* (WIP) Estimating the force of infection using antibody aquisition models
* (WIP) Infection times using reversible jump MCMC
* (WIP) Inferring infection histories using _serosolver_
* (WIP) Time-since-infection machine learning classifier
